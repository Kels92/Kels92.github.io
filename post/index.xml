      <title>Crowdfunding: what does it say about Australian health care?</title>
      <link>https://kels92.github.io/post/mjainsight/</link>

&lt;p&gt;“SOMETHING is seriously wrong if a terminally ill girl with a brain tumour has to raise $120 000 to have surgery,” said Professor Henry Woo in a tweet in May 2019. “If it was a valid surgery, it could/should be performed in the public system under Medicare.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private hospital surgeries with particular specialists are not the only online Australian crowdfunding campaigns for health care-related expenses; other examples include crowdfunding for overseas treatments (here), experimental or unapproved therapies (here), or for general support with associated family costs (here). Why is this the case? In the US, GoFundMe — the most popular crowdfunding website — reports that about a third of their campaigns are for health care-related costs, boasting a total of USD$800 million raised per year. This is likely due to the number of uninsured patients (44 million at last count) and the discourse on high cost medical care in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter White Jr even set up a crowdfunding website for his father’s cancer treatment in the 2009 season of Breaking Bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>The National Strategy to Reduce OOP costs: will price transparency work?</title>
      <link>https://kels92.github.io/post/croakey/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Reducing patients’ out of pocket (OOP) costs is a major issue for the health policy agenda. But what are the chances that solutions to provide real relief for patients will emerge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling this wicked problem was a feature of Labor’s budget response and election campaign. But the Morrison Government does not seem galvanised by patients’ concerns and to date has offered only small reparations: a website that will provide information about specialists’ fees, and the slow unfreezing of the indexation of Medicare rebates (with no guarantee this will lead to a reduction in OOP costs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>My QES Experience – an incoming scholar to McMaster Health Forum</title>

&lt;p&gt;Australia is a long way from most countries, and so every Australian develops their own tricks for coping with the lengthy flights and jetlag. I stubbornly force myself to stick to the local time zone, drinking a near-dangerous amount of coffee until I can collapse in bed at a normal hour. I spent my first weekend in Hamilton, Ontario in this zombie-like-state after a 15 hour, non-stop flight followed by another 6-hour one. Despite this, Hamilton absolutely charmed me from day one (it is an amazing city for anyone who loves craft beer, live music and/or waterfalls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

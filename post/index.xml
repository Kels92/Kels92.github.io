      <title>The National Strategy to Reduce OOP costs: will price transparency work?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Reducing patients’ out of pocket (OOP) costs is a major issue for the health policy agenda. But what are the chances that solutions to provide real relief for patients will emerge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling this wicked problem was a feature of Labor’s budget response and election campaign. But the Morrison Government does not seem galvanised by patients’ concerns and to date has offered only small reparations: a website that will provide information about specialists’ fees, and the slow unfreezing of the indexation of Medicare rebates (with no guarantee this will lead to a reduction in OOP costs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is a long way from most countries, and so every Australian develops their own tricks for coping with the lengthy flights and jetlag. I stubbornly force myself to stick to the local time zone, drinking a near-dangerous amount of coffee until I can collapse in bed at a normal hour. I spent my first weekend in Hamilton, Ontario in this zombie-like-state after a 15 hour, non-stop flight followed by another 6-hour one. Despite this, Hamilton absolutely charmed me from day one (it is an amazing city for anyone who loves craft beer, live music and/or waterfalls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

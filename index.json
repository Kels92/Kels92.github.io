METHODS We downloaded the website data from HCF, Bupa and Medibank on the 18 February 2019. We reviewed the information and statistics provided on these pages, and compared procedures across funds if their pages had referred to the same Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) item/s. We extracted the descriptions of the claims data used, the types of statistics provided, the out-of-pocket estimates, the total procedure cost, the MBS Items referenced and the assumptions the funds’ described on their pages. RESULTS HCF stated the MBS items used to select the claims data for their estimates, while Bupa and Medibank only referred to common MBS items associated with the procedures. HCF had on average 1.44 more MBS items listed than Bupa and 2.08 more than Medibank. The funds organised procedures differently, such as HCF providing separate cost estimates for vaginal, abdominal and keyhole hysterectomy compared to Medibank’s single estimate for hysterectomy costs. CONCLUSIONS These funds have started to address the need for transparent out-of-pocket cost information, but the differences across these pages demonstrate complexities and the potential obfuscation of cost data.","tags":["out-of-pocket costs","private health insurance"],"title":"First steps towards price transparency: comparability of online out-of-pocket tools from Australian private health funds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kelsey Chalmers","Adam G Elshaug","Shaun Larkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561653052,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561653052,"objectID":"e871b2ed9338b4992d500ebaf733c566","permalink":"https://kels92.github.io/talk/onlinetools_ehpr/","publishdate":"2019-07-30T12:30:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/onlinetools_ehpr/","section":"talk","summary":"This talk looks at the information that three Australian private health insurance funds provide online on out-of-pocket costs","tags":["price transparency","out-of-pocket costs"],"title":"Comparability of online out-of-pocket tools from Australian private health funds","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Kelsey Chalmers","Lesley Russell"],"categories":[],"content":" Reducing patients’ out of pocket (OOP) costs is a major issue for the health policy agenda.

Design Analysis of admitted patient data for financial years 2010–2011 to 2016–2017. Main outcome measures Number and proportion of episodes identified as low value by two definitions (narrower and broader), associated costs and bed-days, and variation between hospitals in financial year 2016–2017; trends in numbers of low-value episodes from 2010–2011 to 2016–2017. Results For 27 procedures in 2016–2017, we identified 5079 (narrower definition) to 8855 (broader definition) episodes involving low-value care (11.00%–19.18% of all 46 169 episodes involving these services). These episodes were associated with total inpatient costs of $A49.9 million (narrower) to $A99.3 million (broader), which was 7.4% (narrower) to 14.7% (broader) of the total $A674.6 million costs for all episodes involving these procedures in 2016–2017, and involved 14 348 (narrower) to 29 705 (broader) bed-days. Half the procedures accounted for less than 2% of all low-value episodes identified; three of these had no low-value episodes in 2016–2017. The proportion of low-value care varied widely between hospitals. Of the 14 procedures accounting for most low-value care, seven showed decreasing trends from 2010–2011 to 2016–2017, while three (colonoscopy for constipation, endoscopy for dyspepsia, sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma in situ) showed increasing trends. Conclusions Low-value care in this Australian public hospital setting is not common for most of the measured procedures, but colonoscopy for constipation, endoscopy for dyspepsia and sentinel lymph node biopys for melanoma in situ require further investigation and action to reverse increasing trends. The variation between procedures and hospitals may imply different drivers and potential remedies.","tags":["low-value care","public hospitals"],"title":"Low-value care in Australian public hospitals: prevalence and trends over time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kelsey Chalmers","Sallie-Anne Pearson","Tim Badgery-Parker","Jonathan Brett","Ian A Scott","Adam G Elshaug"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1551421975,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551421975,"objectID":"cbcf84de2fb224d356b0efa7216e6848","permalink":"https://kels92.github.io/publication/measuring/","publishdate":"2019-07-26T16:32:55+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/measuring/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective To examine the prevalence, costs and trends (2010–2014) for 21 low-value inpatient procedures in a privately insured Australian patient cohort. Design We developed indicators for 21 low-value procedures from evidence-based lists such as Choosing Wisely, and applied them to a claims data set of hospital admissions. We used narrow and broad indicators where multiple low-value procedure definitions exist. Setting and participants A cohort of 376 354 patients who claimed for an inpatient service from any of 13 insurance funds in calendar years 2010–2014; approximately 7% of the privately insured Australian population. Main outcome measures Counts and proportions of low-value procedures in 2014, and relative change between 2010 and 2014. We also report both the Medicare (Australian government) and the private insurance financial contributions to these low-value admissions. Results Of the 14 662 patients with admissions for at least 1 of the 21 procedures in 2014, 20.8%–32.0% were low-value using the narrow and broad indicators, respectively. Of the 21 procedures, admissions for knee arthroscopy were highest in both the volume and the proportion that were low-value (1607–2956; 44.4%–81.7%). Seven low-value procedures decreased in use between 2010 and 2014, while admissions for low-value percutaneous coronary interventions and inpatient intravitreal injections increased (51% and 8%, respectively). For this sample, we estimated 2014 Medicare contributions for admissions with low-value procedures to be between $A1.8 and $A2.9 million, and total charges between $A12.4 and $A22.7 million. Conclusions The Australian federal government is currently reviewing low-value healthcare covered by Medicare and private health insurers. Estimates from this study can provide crucial baseline data and inform design and assessment of policy strategies within the Australian private healthcare sector aimed at curtailing the high volume and/or proportions of low-value procedures.","tags":["low-value care","private insurance claims"],"title":"Measuring 21 low-value hospital procedures: claims analysis of Australian private health insurance data (2010–2014)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kelsey Chalmers"],"categories":[],"content":" Australia is a long way from most countries, and so every Australian develops their own tricks for coping with the lengthy flights and jetlag.

Results: We assessed 824 recommendations from the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom CW lists regarding their capacity to be measured in administrative hospital admissions datasets. We selected recommendations if they met the following criteria: the service occurred in the hospital setting (observable in setting); a claim recorded the use of the service (record of service); the appropriate/inappropriate use of the service could be mapped to information within the hospital claim (indication); and the service is consistently recorded in the claims (consistent documentation).

Quantifying these practices at a population level using routinely collected health data allows us to understand the scale of low-value medical practices, measure practice change following specific interventions and prioritise policy decisions. To date, almost all research examining health care through the low-value lens has focused on medical services (tests and procedures) rather than on prescribing. The protocol described herein outlines a program of research funded by Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council to select and quantify low-value prescribing practices within Australian routinely collected health data. Methods We start by describing our process for identifying and cataloguing international low-value prescribing practices. We then outline our approach to translate these prescribing practices into indicators that can be applied to Australian routinely collected health data. Next, we detail methods of using Australian health data to quantify these prescribing practices (e.g. prevalence of low-value prescribing and related costs) and their downstream health consequences. We have approval from the necessary Australian state and commonwealth human research ethics and data access committees to undertake this work. Discussion The lack of systematic and transparent approaches to quantification of low-value practices in routinely collected data has been noted in recent reviews. Here, we present a methodology applied in the Australian context with the aim of demonstrating principles that can be applied across jurisdictions in order to harmonise international efforts to measure low-value prescribing. The outcomes of this research will be submitted to international peer-reviewed journals. Results will also be presented at national and international pharmacoepidemiology and health policy forums such that other jurisdictions have guidance to adapt this methodology.","tags":["low-value care","pharmaceutical claims"],"title":"A methodological protocol for selecting and quantifying low-value prescribing practices in routinely collected data: an Australian case study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kelsey Chalmers","Sallie-Anne Pearson","Adam G Elshaug"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1505886669,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1505886669,"objectID":"776ec1d631074271d94b4facf6cd062e","permalink":"https://kels92.github.io/publication/quantifying_low_value_care/","publishdate":"2019-07-26T15:51:09+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/quantifying_low_value_care/","section":"publication","summary":"Low-value healthcare has been defined as care that is inappropriate for a specific clinical indication, inappropriate for a clinical indication in a specific population or an excessive frequency of services relative to expected benefit.1 Quantifying the prevalence of low-value healthcare informs clinicians and health policy makers on the use and associations of unwarranted care.2 In this Viewpoint, we clarify the approaches used in the literature for measuring and reporting the level of low-value care in a given population.

Direct measurement of overuse through documentation of delivery of inappropriate services is challenging given the difficulty of defining appropriate care for patients with individual preferences and needs; overuse can also be measured indirectly through examination of unwarranted geographical variations in prevalence of procedures and care intensity. Despite the challenges, the high prevalence of overuse is well documented in high-income countries across a wide range of services and is increasingly recognised in low-income countries. Overuse of unneeded services can harm patients physically and psychologically, and can harm health systems by wasting resources and deflecting investments in both public health and social spending, which is known to contribute to health. Although harms from overuse have not been well quantified and trends have not been well described, overuse is likely to be increasing worldwide.","tags":["low-value care"],"title":"Evidence for overuse of medical services around the world","type":"publication"}]

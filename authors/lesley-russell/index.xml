      <title>The National Strategy to Reduce OOP costs: will price transparency work?</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing patients’ out of pocket (OOP) costs is a major issue for the health policy agenda. But what are the chances that solutions to provide real relief for patients will emerge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling this wicked problem was a feature of Labor’s budget response and election campaign. But the Morrison Government does not seem galvanised by patients’ concerns and to date has offered only small reparations: a website that will provide information about specialists’ fees, and the slow unfreezing of the indexation of Medicare rebates (with no guarantee this will lead to a reduction in OOP costs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
